This capstone project is the 10th and final course of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

Project background and context:
The commercial space industry is booming, and companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin and SpaceX offers various space services. SpaceX is the most popular out of the space services providers. In particular, they have been providing relatively inexpensive rocket launches by reusing their first stage of their Falcon 9 rockets.

SpaceX launches have a cost of approximately $62 Million dollars each, compared to its competitors that offer the same service for $165 Million dollars each or even more. The ability to reuse the first stage is a key factor in SpaceX cost savings and popularity among its competitors.
